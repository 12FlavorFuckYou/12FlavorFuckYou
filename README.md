- Hi, I’m @12FlavorFuckYou (Maya)
- I’m currently writing an HTML base for a website I'm building that will compile all of the songs in every library you have together to make one big library.
- I’m currently tinkering with the style.css page of the first (and only) script that I've started so far, seeing how I started this yesterday :) I'm still having some issues with one of the main components of the webpage, so I'm also doing that.
- You can probably reach me by email, not too sure about giving out a phone number publicly like this, but if you do end up emailing go ahead and put "GitHub Inquiry" in the subject line.
